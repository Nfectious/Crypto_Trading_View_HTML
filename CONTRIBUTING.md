# Contributing

Thanks for considering contributing. This project is intentionally small and static; contributions should keep changes minimal and focused.

Guidelines
- Open issues for bugs or feature requests.
- Submit pull requests with a clear description and small, focused changes.
- Keep formatting consistent (HTML/CSS/JS simple, no transpilers).

If you want new functionality (logging, PDF generation, small JS features), open an issue first and we can discuss scope.
